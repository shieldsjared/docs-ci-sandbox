## Team Settings  
___ 

This documentation refers to Mattermost v3.0. For v2.2, see [archived documentation](http://docs.mattermost.com/archives/docs-v2.2.html#team-settings).

The Team Settings menu offers Team Administrators and System Administrators the ability to adjust settings applied to a specific team. 

The following settings are found in a Team Site from the **Three-Dot** menu at the top of the left sidebar under **Team Settings**. 

### General  

General settings under the **Team Settings** > **General** configure how a team is displayed to users. 

#### Team Name

Your **Team Name** is displayed on the sign-in page, and in the top of the left-hand sidebar for your team. 

You can enter a name up to 15 characters in length. The length of team names is limited to ensure readability.

#### Allow anyone to join this team

After a user logs in to the site, they are shown a Team Selection page. Any team with **Allow anyone to join this team** option set to **Yes** will show up on this page under "Open teams you can join".

#### Invite Code 

The **Invite Code** is used as part of the URL in the team invitation link retrieved from the **Main Menu** > **Get Team Invite Link**. Click **Re-Generate** and then **Save** to generate a new team invitation link and invalidate the previous link.

### Import

#### Import from Slack (Beta)

You can import channels and users from Slack into Mattermost from **Team Settings > Import**. Please review our documentation on [Slack Import](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/migrating.html#migrating-from-slack) for more details.
